#Q1

#False
#The results depend upon the size of sample i.e minimum 30 observations.

#FALSE
#Sampling Data is pre processed where NAN values are removed then we take random sampling

#TRUE
#More the data more the patterns more insights 


#Q2

#Population - 9000
#Parameter of Interest - Rating of Product(Kodak Compact Digital Camera)
#Sampling Frame - All readers of the issue where the survey was included
#Sample Size - 225 readers
#Sampling Design -  Targeted Sampling


#Q3

#We know CI = PE + MOE
#Given x=200, std. dev. =30 , n=2000
#Given z values for 94% - t = 1.8916 , 98% - t = 2.3452 , 96% - t = 2.0673
#Putting values in the formula
#The 94% confidence interval is (198.73, 201.27)
#The 96% confidence interval is (198.61, 201.39)
#The 98% confidence interval is (198.43, 201.57)


#Q4

# D) 1

#Q5

# 1) INCORRECT 
# 2) CORRECT
# 3) CORRECT
# 4) CORRECT
# 5) INCORRECT

#Q6

# A) The z-interval is shorter

#Q7

# A) 600

#Q8

# D) 543

#Q9

# 1. C

# 2. B

# 3. A,C,D

# 4. A

#Q10

# 1) TRUE. 
#In this case, at least 30 sample packages must be selected and weighed everyday. Based on the central limit theorem, 
#the sampling distribution of the sample mean approach normal distribution as the sample size become bigger (over 30).

# 2) True


#Q11

# A) False , as std. dev. can change from sample to sample
# B) False , it will be 0.6
# C) False , can be more can be less
# D) False , we can hope so but not 100% sure 
# E) True , 120/sqrt(40000)
